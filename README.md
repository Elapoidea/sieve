as suggested by a Skader, I have made a prime sieve program. 

to use it, execute interface.py with an integer as an argument. the argument will the biggest number in the range you are calculating primes in

for example python3 interface.py 20 will give 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19


feel free to use any and all code here for your own purposes, as long as credit is given in some form.
